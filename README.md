## Project Overview
This project is an external development initiative aimed at creating an Excel plugin specifically for Vectofy (Orange Matter Limited). The primary goal of the plugin is to facilitate the analysis of Excel workbooks by allowing users, particularly those new to Vectofy, to accurately identify all constituent inputs linked to any output cell in complex workbooks.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Smooth integration with Excel, enabling efficient data reading from workbooks.
- **Input Analysis**: Advanced feature to assist users in identifying all inputs contributing to specific output cells, enhancing the understanding of complex data structures.
- **Mulitple Methods of Visualizing Data**:  Our product allows for multifaceted visualization of the data in a workbook by allowing the user to view the process of obtaining the selected cell through an Excel summary sheet, a 2D React Force Graph or a 3D React Force Graph.
